(Jinsil)
There's an empty world, Deep in my heart, save me
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

The truth is hidden by scars, I wanna go back to the happy place
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

(Tiger JK)
Someone, Somewhere will know my miserable heart
It's right in front of me but I can't find it, like an oriole bird
I'm flying around by myself in this darkness, in my lonely night
I'm flying around in this darkness, with a miserable heart
Why don't you know? Even if I'm a small existence
Don't trample on me, instead go with me
Your careless words and actions break me
It corners me, though you deny it
I'm hiding behind the ridicule, don't look for me

(Jinsil)
There's an empty world, Deep in my heart, save me
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset


The truth is hidden by scars, I wanna go back to the happy place
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

(Tiger JK)
It's just a passing wind
I try shouting at the person next to me
But only silence is looking at me
I am walking too but why are we getting further apart?
Why am I standing here alone?
Why is only my world stopping?
I see them fading away, farther and farther
I don't care if it's just one person
Please look back, please hold my hand
I don't care if it's just one time, Please hold my hand
Someone please stop for a moment

(Jinsil)
There's an empty world, Deep in my heart, save me
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

The truth is hidden by scars, I wanna go back to the happy place
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

(Tiger JK)
Your smile that no longer ridicules me
Finds me again from disappearing
In the darkness, your smile
Shines brightly towards my heart

(Jinsil)
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

(Tiger JK)
Your smile that no longer ridicules me
Finds me again from disappearing
In the darkness, your smile
Shines brightly towards my heart

(Jinsil)
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

How about you?
I'm all about you
I want to go back to the beautiful days
Reset

(Tiger JK)
Someone, Somewhere will know my miserable heart
It's right in front of me but I can't find it, like an oriole bird
I'm flying around by myself in this darkness, in my lonely night
I'm flying around in this darkness, with a miserable heart

(Jinsil)
I'm left all alone in this loneliness
Please hold my hand right now
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
The truth is hidden by scars
I wanna got back to the happy place
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset

I won't let you go
I won't let you go
